    "A list is a specific example of an object type in python called a sequence. Sequence types include strings, lists, tuples and xrange objects. They have index numbers associated with each position. We'll learn about xrange when we learn about generators. There are also two less commonly used types -- unicode strings and buffers. The things you can do with all sequences are add, multiply, slice, get len(), min() and max(), and test for membership with in/not in.\n",

    "So far we know the following about lists.\n",

    "- We define them by creating a collection of values inside square brackets, and assigning it to a variable (object) name\n",

    "- We can get each item in a list individually by iterating over it with a for loop (for item in list:)\n",
    "- We create an empty list by using empty square brackets list = []\n",
    "- We need to create an empty list before we can append to it (say, inside a loop)\n",
